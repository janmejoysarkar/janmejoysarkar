# Hi, I'm Janmejoy! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
I'm a PhD scholar at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics and Tezpur University. I specialize in astronomical instrumentation, optics and opto-mechanics.
Currently I work on the Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) instrument of Aditya-L1, India's first space based dedicated solar observatory.

On the flip side, I love mountain biking, callisthenics, and anything that calls for an adventure!

Oh, and I use Arch, btw.
## 🛠 Skills
